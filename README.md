# Todo-app-no-ajax
This is my first project with django framework. This project provides various functionality like: registration, login, logout, search, add todo, update and delete.
The project uses technologies like Python, HTML, CSS and little bit of Javascript.  Javascript is used only for search functionality in the project to make it fast and easy.

It is done with django CBV(class based view). Those todos which have already been done and completed are striked. Below are some of the screenshots of the project:
